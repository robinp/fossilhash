# fossilhash

Some handy Template Haskell splices for including the current fossil hash
and branch in the code of your project. Useful for including in panic
messages, `--version` output, or diagnostic info for more informative
bug reports.

Most of the complication in the `FossilHash` module is... yet unknown.
